## Description
Ratify is an Android app that connects to your Spotify account to **help you rate songs** and **explore your music listening habits**. While the app is running, it automatically tracks songs played on Spotify and lets you quickly rate themâ€”either during playback or afterward. 

Full functionality requires the Spotify app to be installed.
## Installation
To install Ratify on your Android device, go to `Releases` and click on `APK`. Download the `app-debug.apk` on your device, and it should automatically download if permissions are granted.
